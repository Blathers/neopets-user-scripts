Click the "raw" text to get a pretty install option.

## Big Pet

**NOTE**: Because this makes images load large it might take more time to load if you're on a super sluggish connection, keep this in mind!

* Increases the size of pet images on the forums to full size

* Centers pet names and aligns usernames a little

## Neopets Classic Inventory Header

* Replaces the desktop inventory link bar with images in a style that is similar (not exactly the same) to the classic headerbar 
* Adds two middle links to fit the format, top sends you to neopia central and bottom sends you to your shop stock page
* Easily adjustable in the code to your own custom images (and the center options can be adjusted to be whatever links you want)

## Sidebar Always Open

**NOTE**: Because this is doing some extra loading you should probably turn it off when you're trying to restock, just in case it causes more overhead and makes you lose out on an item!

* Gives you the ability to toggle on and off the left sidebar, and it will remember your choice (keep it open or keep it closed)
* Removes the whole page darkening effect when the sidebar is open

## Restock Tracker

**IMPORTANT:** This user script gives NO ADVANTAGE to restocking. It only runs on a successful haggle page and your shop, and simply saves a piece of data when you've made a purchase at a shop.
You need to then manually enter when you sell the item (from your shop page).

* Logs your item, purchase price, and date when you make a purchase on a neopets shop
* Shows shop purchases under the "Sales History" tab of your shop
* Ability to enter the sell price
* Auto calculates your profits and keeps a running "Total Profit" history log
* Clear items manually or with a quick button to remove all. Save history defaults to max of 30, once you reach this items will start being removed from the log.
* Saves monthly total profit history

## Fixed Position SSW
Keeps your SSW and bookmarks always on screen when the page scrolls down instead of hiding behind the top bar. 
Recommended you use this with "Sidebar Always Open" so that they don't overlap stuff on the screen.

## Neopets Beta Animation Toggler
