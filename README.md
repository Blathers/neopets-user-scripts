**NOTE**: Because this makes images load large it might take more time to load if you're on a super sluggish connection, keep this in mind!

* Increases the size of pet images on the forums to full size

* Centers pet names and aligns usernames a little

## Neopets Add Important links

## Sidebar Always Open

**NOTE**: Because this is doing some extra loading you should probably turn it off when you're trying to restock, just in case it causes more overhead and makes you lose out on an item!

* Gives you the ability to toggle on and off the left sidebar, and it will remember your choice (keep it open or keep it closed)
* Removes the whole page darkening effect when the sidebar is open
